## Overview

This version of REddyProc was modified from the original to allow for the detection and implementation of a lower basal respiration rate during the day than at night. Full details of the implemented methods are available in:
Keenan et al. 2019. Nature Ecology and Evolution.

`REddyProc` package supports processing data from Eddy-Covariance sensors.

See the REddyProc master for full details.
